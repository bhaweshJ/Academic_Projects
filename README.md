# Introduction

After exploring possible datasets to use for the final project, I decided to analyze Spotify data available in Kaggle. Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world. 
This project will deal with 50 songs (Observations )having different Track names and artist's name. There are also other variables like Beats per minute, Energy, danceability, Loudness, Liveness, Valence, Length, Acousticness, Speechiness, Popularity. We here to analyze what variable affects the Popularity the most based on the other variables.
This data is in the form of a csv and we will be exploring it in R. we will try fitting a linear regression model to predict the Popularity (independent variable) and evaluate the model's performance.
